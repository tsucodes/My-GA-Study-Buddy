## User stories
 As a programmer Google will always be your best resource however, as a beginner have you ever found yourself stuck wondering what to google? My GA Study Buddy is for General Assembly students that want to improve their familiarity with key Javascript terms. By reviewing JavaScript flashcards students will be able to reinforce what they learn in class and hopefully become better Googlers.

## Unsolved problems
 My reset button places the deck of cards back to the beginning however it does not restart the game. In itsâ€™ current state the user must refresh the page in order to review the cards again.

The code also just cycles through an array of questions. I shoulve have had the cards move to separate stacks after the self-scoring buttons were clicked so the user can review which questions they got right or wrong.
